Muon colliders would produce cleaner collisions and higher effective energies (Accettura et al., 2023); however, muon decays along the accelerator ring create a neutrino beam that crosses a thin slice of the detector radius (Bojorquez-Lopez et al., 2025). 
Beam-induced neutrinos (BINs) in a muon collider would provide the largest sample size of detectable neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron interactions. 
Therefore, studying BINs also furthers Standard Model physics through precision measurements of the Weak force with neutrinos.

In this repository, my research attempts to quantify and characterize the BIN interaction rates and spatial distributions within a muon collider detector as well as assess their potential for precise measurements.
